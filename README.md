# Astronomy

## Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society

*(copied [from this page](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/General_Instructions#2.1%20LaTeX))*

For authors preparing their manuscripts using LaTeX, MNRAS has its own LaTeX class files which simulate the appearance of the journal page. Authors are encouraged to use these, although papers prepared using other class files can also be accepted.

From June 2015 a major update to this package, version 3.0, has been made available.

The journal class files and documentation are available at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) site in this directory. The package consists of a readme.txt file, the class file mnras.cls, a bibliography style file mnras.bst for authors wishing to use BibTeX, and documentation explaining how to use them. A simple template paper is also available.

## Astronomy & Astrophysics

*(copied from [this page](https://www.aanda.org/for-authors/latex-issues/texnical-background-information))*
 
 As the articles for A&A will be available in different formats - one of these is full-text-searchable hyper-text - we strongly suggest you strictly obey the LaTeX conventions.

 The A&A document class was derived from the LaTeX2e article.cls based on TEX version 3.141 and LaTeX2e. You may use it with the LaTeX engine or the PDFLaTeX engine. Be sure that the LaTeX version is at least the 2007 version. Hence formulas and text are typed using the standard LaTeX2e commands. The standard sectioning commands are also kept. Using aa.cls with other versions or implementations may cause difficulties. If this is the case, please contact us and we will try to help you.

 Please refrain from using any self-made definitions since these will get lost during further conversion of your text. If you use typing abbreviations, "search and replace" them before submitting your article to the publisher.

# Physics

## JCAP/JHEP

A LaTeX2e package which emulates the JCAP and JHEP styles are made available for preparing preprints to be submitted to the journals.
Manuals, bibliography style (bst) and example tex files are also provided.

## REVTeX

REVTeX is a collection of LaTeX macros, with auxiliary files and a user support guide, which is maintained and distributed by the American Physical Society as part of a “REVTeX toolbox”. REVTeX is used to submit papers to journals published by the American Physical Society (APS), the American Institute of Physics (AIP), and the Optical Society of America (OSA), and is accepted by a few other technical publishers as well.

## IOP publishing

A LaTeX2e class file together with full documentation that is distributed by the Institute of Physics (IOP) publishing to help authors prepare articles for consideration by IOP journals. A full list of journals can be found through the link below.
